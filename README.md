**Refactorer: "one-stop" solutions of NFTsâ€™ liquidity.**

In order to solve the liquidity problem of NFT market, Refactorer put forward a creative approach that uses four chains and two tokens to realize the combination of DeFi and NFT value, so as to realize NFT as the core of asset value.
Refactorer is expected to support non-fungible token assets of all public chains in the future. Users only need to upload assets to Refactorer and make their own split selection to start the fragmentation generation function.
Users will participate in mining during the process of NFT generation or splitting, so that users can obtain token incentives form the entire process of uploading, ecology, trading, splitting, synthesizing NFT and auction.
